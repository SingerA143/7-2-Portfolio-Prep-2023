How do I approach designing software?
- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
- What design process did you follow for your project work?
- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The new design skills has my work helped me to craft is designing shapes of your image you're trying to make and animate it if I'm correct. ALso, using computer coding and I use C++ on Visual Studio and it's one of the hard languages that I did even though this is my suggestion on a type of computer coding once I started computer science. The design process I follow for my project work is testing on how the project is going to be, especially if I'm gonna have errors on the coding. The kind of tactics that will be applied in future work is focusing on the issue and how/what can I do to fix the issue so that there won't be any errors.

How do I approach developing programs?
- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
- How did iteration factor into your development?
- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

The strategies I used while working on my 3D is using the libraries and tutorials from the modules two to six because it was helpful and if they didn't they had it, I would've been stressed out considering that this is the most challenging class I have ever taken. The iteration factor into my development is trying to create my own coding to create my light in our 2D or 3D scene and test it once I get it correctly. My approach to developing code throughout the milestones was helpful because of the tutorials even though I was having issues because I wasn't doing it correctly and I was trying my best. 


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Computer science help me in reaching my goals in my future educational and professional pathway is developing new skills which is something I can relate to because computer science is a challenge and hopefully I will find a job that is rewarding but fun to do but a job is a job. Also, solving problems is important because when you see a problem on a coding or science problem , look through what you have to do and just mindset on how you can fix this problem without jumping into conclusions.
